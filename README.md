SYSTEM ANALYSIS
System analysis is the process of gathering and interpreting facts, diagnosing problems, and using
the information to recommend improvements on the system. System analysis is a problem-solving
activity that requires intensive communication between the system users and system developers.
System analysis or study is an important phase of any system development process. The system is
viewed as a whole, the inputs are identified, and the system is subjected to close study to identify
the problem areas. The solutions are given as a proposal. The proposal is reviewed on user request
and suitable changes are made. This loop ends as soon as the user is satisfied with the proposal.

PROBLEM STATEMENT :
The current food system is often characterized by a long and complex supply chain that involves multiple intermediaries between farmers and consumers. This can lead to inefficiencies, food waste, and higher prices for consumers. Moreover, small-scale farmers often face challenges in accessing markets and selling their produce at fair prices.
The problem is that the current food system is not sustainable, equitable, or transparent. There is a lack of direct communication and transactions between farmers and consumers, which creates a lack of trust and transparency in the food system. Furthermore, consumers often lack information about the sources of their food and the farming practices used to grow it, making it difficult for them to make informed decisions about their food purchases.
The direct farmer-to-consumer app aims to address these challenges by providing a platform that connects small-scale farmers directly to consumers. By eliminating intermediaries, the app enables farmers to market their produce directly to consumers and set fair prices. The app also provides valuable information about farmers and their farming practices, giving consumers the opportunity to make informed decisions about their food purchases. By facilitating direct transactions and communication, the app helps build trust and create a more transparent and equitable food system.

Product Listings: The output design for product listings should display product details such as name, description, price, quantity, and other relevant information. The design should also include product images and reviews to help users make informed purchasing decisions.
Search Results: The output design for search results should display a list of products that match the user's search criteria. The design should include relevant product details and images, as well as filtering options to further refine the search.
Shopping Cart: The output design for the shopping cart should display the list of products that the user has added to their cart, along with the price, quantity, and total cost of each item. The design should also include options to update or remove items from the cart.
Order Confirmation: The output design for the order confirmation should display the details of the user's order, including the total cost, shipping details, and estimated delivery date.
The input and output design of the direct farmer-to-consumer app should be intuitive and user-friendly, allowing users to easily enter and retrieve information. The design should also include appropriate feedback and validation checks to ensure that the user enters correct data and receives accurate information.


DATABASE DESIGN
3.2 DATABASE
Databases are the storehouses of data used in the software systems. The data is stored in tables
inside the database. Several tables are created for the manipulation of the data for the system. Two
essential settings for a database are
▪ Primary key - the field that is unique for all the record occurrences
▪ Foreign key - the field used to set relation between tables
Normalization is a technique to avoid redundancy in the tables.

3.3 SYSTEM TOOLS
The various system tools that have been used in developing both the front end and the back end of
the project are being discussed in this chapter.

3.3.1 FRONT END
React is a library which is developed by Facebook are utilized to implement the frontend. React
(also known as React.js or ReactJS) is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library for
building user interfaces or UI components. It is maintained by Facebook and a community of
individual developers and companies. React can be used as a base in the development of single
page or mobile applications. However, React is only concerned with state management and
rendering that state to the DOM, so creating React applications usually requires the use of
additional libraries for routing, as well as certain client-side functionality.


3.3.2 BACKEND
The back end is implemented using MySQL which is used to design databases

MySQL:
MySQL is the world's second most widely used open-source relational database management
system (RDBMS). The SQL phrase stands for Structured Query Language. An application
software called Navicert was used to design the tables in MySQL.

Spring-Boot:
This is used to connect MYSQL and fetch data from database and store the data in database. The
Spring Framework is an application framework and inversion of control container for the Java
platform. The framework's core features can be used by any Java application, but there are
extensions for building web applications on top of the Java EE (Enterprise Edition) platform.
Although the framework does not impose any specific programming model, it has become popular
in the Java community as an addition to the Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB) model. The Spring
Framework is Open-source Framework.
