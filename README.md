SYSTEM ANALYSIS
System analysis is the process of gathering and interpreting facts, diagnosing problems, and using
the information to recommend improvements on the system. System analysis is a problem-solving
activity that requires intensive communication between the system users and system developers.
System analysis or study is an important phase of any system development process. The system is
viewed as a whole, the inputs are identified, and the system is subjected to close study to identify
the problem areas. The solutions are given as a proposal. The proposal is reviewed on user request
and suitable changes are made. This loop ends as soon as the user is satisfied with the proposal.

PROBLEM STATEMENT :
The current food system is often characterized by a long and complex supply chain that involves multiple intermediaries between farmers and consumers. This can lead to inefficiencies, food waste, and higher prices for consumers. Moreover, small-scale farmers often face challenges in accessing markets and selling their produce at fair prices.
The problem is that the current food system is not sustainable, equitable, or transparent. There is a lack of direct communication and transactions between farmers and consumers, which creates a lack of trust and transparency in the food system. Furthermore, consumers often lack information about the sources of their food and the farming practices used to grow it, making it difficult for them to make informed decisions about their food purchases.
The direct farmer-to-consumer app aims to address these challenges by providing a platform that connects small-scale farmers directly to consumers. By eliminating intermediaries, the app enables farmers to market their produce directly to consumers and set fair prices. The app also provides valuable information about farmers and their farming practices, giving consumers the opportunity to make informed decisions about their food purchases. By facilitating direct transactions and communication, the app helps build trust and create a more transparent and equitable food system.
